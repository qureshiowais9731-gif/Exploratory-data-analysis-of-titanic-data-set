Titanic Survival Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🚢 Project Overview

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the classic Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to leverage statistical methods and data visualization to understand the passenger demographics, socioeconomic factors, and family dynamics that influenced survival rates during the disaster. The insights derived from this analysis are crucial for effective feature engineering and building a robust predictive model.

How to Run the Analysis

1. Project Summary

This EDA focuses on uncovering the primary factors influencing passenger survival. Analysis reveals a strong socioeconomic gradient: survival is positively correlated with the ticket Fare (+0.26) and negatively correlated with Passenger Class (-0.34). This clearly indicates that 1st class passengers and those who paid higher fares were significantly more likely to survive, reflecting the "women and children first" policy in higher-class lifeboats. Distribution analysis showed that the Fare data is heavily right-skewed, while Age is concentrated in the 20-40 range.

3. Key Findings

The following inferences were drawn directly from the statistical summaries and visualizations generated by eda_titanic.py:

Survival Bias: First-class passengers showed a distinctly higher survival rate compared to 2nd and 3rd class passengers, highlighting the importance of socioeconomic status in rescue prioritization.

Wealth Effect: The distribution of Fare across passenger classes confirmed that 1st class fares are significantly higher and exhibit the most variance and outliers, demonstrating the extreme difference in wealth among passengers.

Demographics: The Age distribution shows that the majority of passengers were young adults (20-40), but a sharp spike in the 0-5 age range suggests children were a notable demographic.

Correlation Hotspots: The heatmap strongly confirmed the inverse relationship between Pclass and Fare (-0.55), reinforcing the class structure of the ship.

5. How to Run the Analysis

Clone the Repository:

git clone [your-repo-link]
cd titanic-eda


Install Dependencies: This project requires pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Execute the Script:

python eda_titanic.py


The script will print all statistical summaries to the console and display the generated plots.
